# To-Do

A List App developed with a Flutter front end and a Java backend using socket programming. 

The application includes essential user authentication features, such as sign-up and sign-in, and provides a personalized experience by managing each user’s profile data. 

The backend server, written in Java, handles requests and responses, ensuring seamless communication between the app’s interface and the database. Each button in the Flutter app triggers specific actions that the Java server processes, maintaining the integrity and responsiveness of the application. 

# The project showcases: 
- Socket Programming: For efficient and real-time client-server communication. 
- User Authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in processes. 
- Profile Management: Each user has a personalized profile with their own to-do list data. 
- Flutter UI: A smooth and responsive user interface built with Flutter. 

This repository is a great example of how to integrate Flutter with a custom Java backend, demonstrating the full stack of developing a cross-platform application with secure and efficient data handling.
